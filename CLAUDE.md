# Ride-Hailing Microservices — Project Guide

## What this is

A from-scratch learning/demo project: a mini ride-hailing backend (rider requests a trip, gets matched to a nearby driver, tracks them live, gets notified through state changes), built as 6 independent Node.js/TypeScript microservices. The point isn't a polished product — it's deliberate practice with distributed-systems problems: event-driven state machines, Redis geospatial queries, WebSocket streaming, and above all **correct concurrent matching** (never double-assign a driver to two riders at once).

## Status

Step 1 (Docker Compose skeleton) is done and verified: `docker compose up --build` brings up all 8 containers (postgres, redis, gateway, auth-service, trip-service, matching-service, location-service, notification-service), each Node service is a bare Express stub exposing `GET /health`, and all healthchecks pass.

Step 2 (Auth service + Gateway JWT verification) is done and verified end-to-end.

Auth service: `users` table (`id`, `email` unique, `password`, `name`, `role` check `rider`/`driver`, `created_at`) via `node-pg-migrate` (CommonJS-style migration files — the tool's ESM template default conflicts with this project's `"module": "commonjs"` tsconfig), migrations run automatically on container start (`sh -c "npm run migrate:up && npm run dev"` in docker-compose), `pg` Pool wired via `DATABASE_URL`, `JWT_SECRET` set (same value) on both `auth-service` and `gateway` in docker-compose. `POST /auth/signup` and `POST /auth/login` are both implemented and tested (bcrypt hash/compare, JWT issuance, `23505` unique-violation → clean 409 on signup, generic "Email or password is incorrect" 401 on both bad-email and bad-password login cases to avoid user-enumeration). Request validation is in place via zod schemas (`signupSchema`, `loginSchema`) applied through a reusable `validate(schema)` middleware factory, and a centralized `errorHandler` middleware (last in the Express stack) translates thrown `HttpError`s into proper status codes.

Gateway: `verifyToken` middleware reads `Authorization: Bearer <token>`, verifies via `jwt.verify` with the shared `JWT_SECRET`, and attaches the decoded `{ sub, role }` payload to `req.user` (typed via a global `Express.Request` augmentation in `src/types/express.d.ts`) before calling `next()`; invalid/expired/missing tokens all return a clean `401` through the same `HttpError`/`errorHandler` pattern used in auth-service. `POST/GET /auth/*` is proxied to `auth-service` via `http-proxy-middleware` (`pathRewrite` needed to restore the `/auth` prefix Express strips when a router is mounted with `app.use("/auth", ...)`), left public/unprotected since signup/login happen before a token exists. A temporary `GET /me` route (protected by `verifyToken`, echoes `req.user`) still exists for quick middleware checks. `/trips/*` is now a real protected proxy: `app.use("/trips", verifyToken, tripsProxy)`, where `tripsProxy` (`src/proxy/tripsProxy.ts`) injects `x-user-id`/`x-user-role` headers onto the outgoing request from `req.user` via `http-proxy-middleware`'s `on.proxyReq` hook (v4.2.0 API — `on: { proxyReq: (proxyReq, req) => {...} }`, not the older `onProxyReq` option). Verified end-to-end: signup → login → create a trip through the Gateway, with the DB row's `rider_id` confirmed to match the JWT's `sub` claim.

Step 3 (Trip service) is in progress. `trips` table (`id`, `rider_id`, `driver_id` nullable, `status` check across all 7 state-machine states with default `'requested'`, `origin_lat/lng`, `dest_lat/lng` as `double precision`, `cancelled_by`, `cancellation_reason`, `requested_at`/`matched_at`/`completed_at`/`cancelled_at`, `created_at`) via `node-pg-migrate`, same pattern as auth-service (migrations auto-run on container start). `POST /trips` is implemented and tested end-to-end (through the Gateway, not just directly): reads `rider_id` from the Gateway-forwarded `x-user-id` header (not the request body — trip-service trusts the Gateway's JWT verification rather than re-verifying), rejects with 403 if `x-user-role` is `driver`, validates the body via zod (`createTripSchema`, lat ∈ [-90,90], lng ∈ [-180,180]), inserts, returns `{ tripId, status }`. `trip.requested` event emission is deliberately stubbed (`// TODO` comment) pending step 4's event-bus helper. Not started yet: `GET /trips/:id` (fetch + rider/driver ownership check), `POST /trips/:id/cancel` (state-machine-guarded cancel, designed but not written — see plan: fetch trip, check existence/ownership/cancellable-state, then `UPDATE ... WHERE status NOT IN ('in_progress','completed','cancelled')` as a race-safe guard, optional `reason` in body). Gateway's `tripsProxy` already covers these paths for free once written, no extra Gateway wiring needed.

## Confirmed Stack & Decisions

- **Language**: TypeScript across all services
- **Services**: Auth, Trip, Matching, Location/Tracking, Notification, API Gateway (6 total) + React/Leaflet frontend demo
- **Databases**: Postgres (single container, two logical DBs: `auth_db`, `trip_db`), Redis (geo index + driver state + event bus, single instance, three roles)
- **Event bus**: Redis Streams with consumer groups (not RabbitMQ) — reuses the Redis instance already needed for geo/pub-sub
- **Driver-claim race condition fix**: pending-offer with TTL lock (not instant hard-assign) — a Redis Lua script atomically flips driver status `available → offered`, offer expires via TTL if driver doesn't respond, Matching service retries next-nearest candidate on reject/timeout

                      Redis Streams (event bus) -------------------
                      + Redis (driver status / offer keys, geo set)
```

Happy-path event flow: `trip.requested` → Matching consumes → GEOSEARCH nearby available drivers → creates pending offer on top candidate → `trip.offer.created` → Notification pushes to driver → driver accepts/rejects/times out within TTL → `trip.matched` (or retry next candidate) → Trip service transitions state → Notification pushes to rider/driver → Location service streams driver position → `trip.completed`/`trip.cancelled`.

## Services

1. **Auth** — signup/login, bcrypt, issues JWT (`{ sub, role, iat, exp }`). Owns `auth_db.users`. Only the Gateway calls it directly.
2. **Trip** — source of truth for trip state (`requested → offer_pending → matched → driver_en_route → in_progress → completed`, `cancelled` reachable pre-`in_progress`). Owns `trip_db.trips`. Creates trips via REST, but transitions past `requested` happen only via consumed events.
3. **Matching** — the core hard problem. Consumes `trip.requested`, GEOSEARCH candidates, atomic Lua-script claim (pending-offer + TTL), retry logic on reject/timeout, emits `trip.matched` or `trip.no_drivers_available`. Must be safe to run as multiple concurrent instances.
4. **Location/Tracking** — ingests driver location over WebSocket, writes to Redis (`drivers:geo` + last-position hash), streams position to the rider on any active trip.
5. **Notification** — consumes all `trip.*`/offer events, relays to the right Socket.IO room (keyed by userId). Stateless relay only, never mutates trip/driver state.
6. **API Gateway** — single entry point, JWT verification, REST routing, WS proxy, forwards `x-user-id`/`x-user-role` headers downstream.

## Data Stores

- **Postgres**: `auth_db` (Auth), `trip_db` (Trip) — no cross-service joins, no shared tables.
- **Redis**:
  1. Geo index: `drivers:geo` (GEOADD per driverId)
  2. Driver state: `driver:{id}:status` ∈ `{offline, available, offered, matched}`, `driver:{id}:offer` (TTL = offer timeout)
  3. Event bus: `stream:trip-events`, consumer groups per service (`matching-service`, `trip-service`, `notification-service`)

## Event Schemas (`stream:trip-events`)

Envelope: `{ eventId, type, occurredAt, data }`

| Event | Producer | Data |
|---|---|---|
| `trip.requested` | Trip | `{ tripId, riderId, originLat, originLng, destLat, destLng, requestedAt }` |
| `trip.offer.created` | Matching | `{ tripId, driverId, expiresAt }` |
| `trip.offer.accepted` | Matching | `{ tripId, driverId }` |
| `trip.offer.rejected` | Matching | `{ tripId, driverId, reason: 'declined'\|'timeout' }` |
| `trip.matched` | Matching | `{ tripId, driverId, matchedAt }` |
| `trip.no_drivers_available` | Matching | `{ tripId }` |
| `trip.state_changed` | Trip | `{ tripId, from, to, changedAt }` |
| `trip.cancelled` | Trip | `{ tripId, cancelledBy, reason }` |
| `driver.location_updated` | Location | `{ driverId, lat, lng, heading, ts }` (may use plain Redis pub/sub, not the durable stream) |

## REST API Contracts (via Gateway)

| Method & Path | Service | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /auth/signup` | Auth | `{ email, password, role }` → `{ token }` |
| `POST /auth/login` | Auth | `{ email, password }` → `{ token }` |
| `POST /trips` | Trip | rider creates trip → `{ tripId, status }` |
| `GET /trips/:id` | Trip | current trip state |
| `POST /trips/:id/cancel` | Trip | rider/driver cancels |
| `POST /offers/:tripId/accept` | Matching | driver accepts current offer |
| `POST /offers/:tripId/reject` | Matching | driver declines current offer |
| `POST /drivers/status` | Location/Matching | driver toggles `available`/`offline` |

WebSocket (Socket.IO via Gateway): client authenticates handshake with JWT, joins room by `userId`; server emits `trip:update`, `offer:new`, `location:update`.

## Docker Compose Layout (planned)

Services: `gateway`, `auth-service`, `trip-service`, `matching-service`, `location-service`, `notification-service`, `postgres`, `redis`, `frontend`. Internal Docker network — only `gateway` and `frontend` publish host ports.

## Build Order

1. ~~Docker Compose skeleton + Postgres/Redis wiring + health-checked empty services~~ — done
2. ~~Auth service + Gateway JWT verification~~ — done
3. Trip service (schema, state machine, REST, `trip.requested` producer) *(next up)*
4. Shared Redis Streams event-bus helper package
5. Matching service (GEOSEARCH + Lua-script pending-offer claim + retry logic)
6. Location service (WS ingestion, geo updates, position streaming)
7. Notification service (Socket.IO rooms + event relay)
8. React + Leaflet demo wired end-to-end
9. Race-condition test: fire many concurrent `trip.requested` events at the same driver pool, confirm no driver is ever double-offered/double-matched

## Open Question

Whether the offer TTL sweep is driven by Redis key-expiry + keyspace notifications, or a polling sweep in the Matching service — decide when implementing that service.

## Maintenance Instruction

**Always update this file automatically after any significant change** — a new service scaffolded, an architecture/schema decision changed, a build-order step completed, a new event/endpoint added, etc. Don't wait to be asked. Keep this document in sync with reality so the next session can pick up context cold.
